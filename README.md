**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving**

The project is solving the problem of finding the frequency of words in a given input file and displaying it in different forms to the user.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think the code I wrote is well-structured. I used proper naming comventions and included necessary in-line comments for better understanding.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

The code could be enhanced by using error handling techniques to handle user input errors and file access errors more gracefully. Improving the input validation in the program can also make it stronger.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

Writing the optionThree() function to print the histogram form was the most challenging part of the code as it required implementing a loop inside a loop. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and testing each part separately.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

The tools or resources that could be added to the support network could be source code management tools like Git, integrated development environments like Visual Studio, or online forums like Stack Overflow.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?** 

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following the best practices of clean code, such as using descriptive function and variable names, providing in-line comments, and dividing the program into smaller functions for better modularity and readability.
